# Read Back Comments
This plugin will automatically add a button to the comment form to read back the current comment text.

It makes use of the Speech Synthesis API and is therefor _not_ going to work in all browsers. But that's okay, because this is really just for fun.

Inspired by [https://xkcd.com/481/](https://xkcd.com/481/).

## TODO
* Add i18n.
* Handle support for other comment plugins (JetPack?)
* Settings screen for voice settings
