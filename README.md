# Read Back Comments
This plugin will automatically add a button to the comment form to read back the current comment text.

It makes use of the Speech Synthesis API and is therefor _not_ going to work in all browsers. But that's okay, because this is really just for fun.

Inspired by https://xkcd.com/481/.

## TODO
* Add i18n.
* Handle support for other comment plugins (JetPack? Disqus?)
